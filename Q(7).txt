
Question :
Suppose that we have a relation marks(ID, score) and we wish to assign grades to
students based on the score as follows: grade F if score < 40 , grade C if 40 ≤ score < 60,
grade B if 60 ≤ score < 80, and grade A if 80 ≤ score. Write SQL queries to do the
following: a. Display the grade for each student, based on the marks relation. b. Find the
number of students with each grade

Practical:
mysql> use A;
Database changed
mysql> create table marks (
    ->     ID int primary key,
    ->     score int
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.10 sec)

mysql> insert into marks values
    -> (101, 33),
    -> (102, 55),
    -> (103, 64),
    -> (104, 85),
    -> (105, 75),
    -> (106, 40),
    -> (107, 95);
Query OK, 7 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> select ID,

    ->        case
    ->            when score < 40 then 'F'
    ->            when score >= 40 and score < 60 then 'C'
    ->            when score >= 60 and score < 80 then 'B'
    ->            when score >= 80 then 'A'
    ->        end as grade
    -> from marks;
